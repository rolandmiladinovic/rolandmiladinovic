Out walking Brunswick Street again one evening, along with Ajax, taking our place amongst the freaks, homeless, lunatics, criminals, prostitutes, meth addicts, buskers, cripples, drag queens, bogans, strippers, aboriginals, cops, and backpackers. We enter a late night hipster cafe and order something as a pretext for charging our phones as there’s no electricity at home. When I noticed on the walls are hanging large canvases by this woman erotic artist, Zazie. Great pop-art messes of paint running down in lurid colours over spiral nippled breasts. The muse to one of my first watercolours of which I sent her—a simple female nude outline in her style over a mess of colour. She liked my use of colour and told me I’d get better with time … But she became cold and disagreeable once I told her that I’ve given up all ambitions for working and careers, and shared a fantasy where she’d quit her receptionist job too and we’d just paint the days away in some run down warehouse studio as we descend further into poverty and madness. No, she must have money for travel and for seeing here favourite bands, and for all the comforts a woman requires. Though she confessed she’d done exactly that, last year, and it was the worst year of her life….

Stepping back out onto Brunswick Street, there’s this guy we just met the other night at a Hip Hop open mic, Fitzy, busking out Hotel California from sidewalk steps. He drops the guitar to greet us and we’re talking talking blah blah blah, while a woman sitting beside him (Sarah, we’ll call her) picks it up and is plucking away at simple pretty notes laughing at herself. Fitzy has to run off to some party and he’s obviously trying to palm the woman off onto us and leave right away. “Hey, why don’t you go hang out with these guys,” he says to Sarah, and she looks up at us all smiles and says “yeah, yeah … okay.” In lovely voice. Her long dark hair is a wig, she’s crazy and heroin chic, full lips, full breasts, a straw fedora, adjusting her bra. With half her teeth missing she smiles freely, madly, and beautifully. One of her street friends is arguing with the cops and so they’re leading him away with the strong arm and Sarah is running along after them trying to hand the cops his forgotten hat, but they’re not interested.

Back at the studio, Sarah is happy, Innocent as a child, no word of judgment, present to the moment, natural creator, serious in play. Sitting at desk reciting original rhyming poems in a well trained voice for theater. I wish she were performing up on a dark and smokey stage where she would be loved and would strum away at an acoustic guitar to the music of her own stream of consciousness.

Seeing the tubes of paint, watercolours, charcoals, tools, instruments, candles, wine, laying strewn about the floor she goes down to investigate and starts opening tubes of paint giggling to herself. She works on four paintings at the same time laying the colours on thick and fast.



I want to talk with her, to reach out, to know anything about her, to learn from her even. But it’s impossible to find an appropriate question. And I become shocked when realised how ridiculous it is to ask her questions about the future or even the past. I’m also in the wrong position, talking to her from a distance, perched up on a chair, observing her play, smoking cigarettes. To communicate with her I must get down on the floor, on hands and knees, and paint.

While I’m there staring at a blank piece paper unable to begin, just holding my paintbrush loaded with black over the rectangle of white. Waiting for an image to arrive, for a face to appear, anything. I look over to see what Sarah is doing she has the top over a tube of silver acrylic paint painting with the bottle is mad fast circles. Sarah is so freeing to be around. Ajax is painting the words, “PRESCHOOL” and I decide it’s an entrance plaque to the studio. Signifying Zarathustra’s fourth metamorphosis of the soul, or our regression to idiocy?

She’s laughing and being all amazed talking to herself, “O! So Sarah must of went off and it was you Jane who was in control this whole time! Wow!” “Ah yeah, he wouldn’t have been able to tell because you still look the same” , “yeah, yeah”

“O Yeah, so I have multiple personalities.”
“I am many”

She’s beautifully cracked mad maelstrom of souls roaring within. Lord of her own populated universe. It’s why she can’t give up the meth … the meth psychosis keeps the other souls alive.

She asks nothing and expects nothing in return.

Ajax crashes out in the corner and I stay up with her all night attempting to capture her portrait in charcoal, captivated by the study of her face. We talk as I paint her I become aware that she is changed again, and I become completely convinced she is infact a drag queen and I’ve been blind this whole time.

I crash out in a camping chair and she sits beside me and pulls out a book from her handbag. It’s Goosebumps and we read chapters to each other until the sun rises.

When she finally does go to sleep she is dead to the world for almost forty-eight hours. Sarah coming off meth is a Logan Bogan dressed like a man with a mohawk that is usually hidden under her wig, and she is stressed out and ill at ease. Reduced to rocking on a chair smoking dumpers [cigarette ends] from a small brass pipe. Losing control of the ensemble of personalities she commands.

She can’t do anything but must do something. She’s losing it without stimulation unable to bear her own thoughts and voices. And now I feel the full force of her agitation and anger and pain and I’m definitely starting to feel annoyed and regret and resent her. 

I want to help her. I want to take her into my arms and give her any comfort I can. But touch distressed and confuses her from her profound loneliness. I think about teaching her to meditate but know that it will be useless. When I realise that it’s me who needs to meditate, to learn to meditate. So this time it’s me who changes character. Now I’m a Zen monk and I’m wearing just a bed sheet wrapped around to look like a robe and I just sit there half lotus with hands on knees, eyes opened, downcast, closed, it doesn’t matter. 

She’s about to blow her top off though yelling at children in her head and seems to be on the edge of tearing the place down, desperate for the stimulation of chaos. And I tell her to let it all out, yell and scream all she wants, tear the place down if needs be. But I just sit there observing, witnessing, listening, listening to myself listening, smiling at my own stupid annoyances or worries about property. The more chaos the better; what do I care? I just weather the storm. I watch patterns of spilled paint on the floor turn into dancing lovers, I observe my breath. I rest in peace. She eventually settles down and sits on a chair and is silent for a few minutes then murmuring, then silent. When she is saved by her own laughter for a while and she goes out walking.

Returning, we both start painting again and she is telling me all about this guy she  just met at the park, Ryan, a Buddhist. And they did Tai Chi together and she feels so much better and silenced now. And she is all smiles and paints a portrait of her new hero, Ryan, surrounded in golden energy.

Last time I saw Sarah she was sitting on a brick ledge amongst the other drug addicts and rough sleepers, eating a free breakfast put on by the local Christian college kids. With a messy blond wig on backwards as she fixes her own silly plats, chatting and laughing away amongst herselves. A beacon of light amongst the hung heads and hopelessness. Her presence turns all these down and outers into gentleman as she makes the rounds talking to each one.

I haven’t seen Sarah in two weeks, and with the dawn of the day I go out walking Brunswick St alone. There will be a thousand people crossing paths along this street today, But at this hour it all belongs to one man. Cool wind blowing, heralding storms. There sits Ryan apon concrete pillar, shirtless, cargo pants, hiking boots, ropy muscles, straight iron bar spine, lion’s mane bending to the wind, thousand mile stare. Zen smoking dumped cigarette butt elbow up and pinky out, deep controlled breath, as though ceremoniously savouring a fine oolong.
