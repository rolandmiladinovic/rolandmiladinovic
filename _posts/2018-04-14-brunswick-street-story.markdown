Out walking Brunswick Street again one evening, along with Ajax, taking our place amongst the freaks, homeless, lunatics, criminals, prostitutes, meth addicts, buskers, cripples, drag queens, bogans, strippers, bouncers, aboriginals, cops, and backpackers. We enter a late night hipster cafe and order something as a pretext for charging our phones as there’s no electricity at home. When I noticed on the walls are hanging large canvases by this woman erotic artist, Zazie. Great pop-art messes of paintings with paint running down in primary colours over spiral nippled breasts. Ten years or so my senior, we had been messaging over Tinder—A minor muse who inspired one of my first watercolours of which I sent her: a simple female nude outline in her style over a mess of colour. She liked my use of colour and told me I’d get better with time … But she became cold to me once I shared a fantasy where we’d quit our jobs and paint the days away in some run down warehouse studio as we descend into poverty and madness. No, she must have money for travel and for seeing here favourite bands, and for all the comforts a woman requires. Though she confessed she had done exactly this, last year, and it was the worst year of her life….

Stepping back out onto Brunswick Street, there’s this guy Fitzy, busking out Hotel California from sidewalk steps. And he drops the guitar and we’re talking talking blah blah blah, while the woman sitting beside him (Sarah, we’ll call her) picks up the guitar and is plucking away at simple pretty notes laughing at herself. Fitzy has to run off to some party and he’s obviously trying to palm the woman off onto us and leave right away. “Hey, why don’t you go hang out with these guys,” he says to Sarah, and she looks up at us all smiles and says “yeah … okay.” In lovely tones. Her long dark hair is a wig, she’s crazy and heroin chic, full lips, full breasts, a straw fedora, adjusting her bra. With half her teeth missing she smiles freely and beautifully. One of her street friends is arguing with the cops and they’re leading him away with the strong arm and Sarah is running after them trying to hand the cops his forgotten hat. They’re not interested.

Back at the studio, Sarah is happy, Innocent as a child, no words of judgment, present to the moment, natural creator, serious in play. Sitting at desk reciting original rhyming poems in a well trained voice for a theater. I wish she were performing up on a dark and smokey stage where she would be loved and would strum away at an acoustic guitar to the music of her own stream of consciousness.

Seeing the tubes of paint, watercolours, charcoals, tools, instruments, candles, wine, strewn about the floor she goes down to investigate and starts opening tubes of paint giggling to herself. She works on four paintings at the same time laying on colours thick and fast.

While I’m there staring at a blank piece paper unable to begin, just holding my paintbrush loaded with black over the rectangle of white. Waiting for a vision to arrive. For a face to appear, anything, but no. When I look over to see what Sarah is doing she has the top over a tube of silver acrylic paint painting with the bottle is mad fast circles. Sarah is so freeing to be around. Ajax is painting the words, “PRESCHOOL” and I decide it’s an entrance plaque to the studio. Signifying Zarathustra’s fourth metamorphosis of the soul.

I want to talk with her, to reach out, to know anything about her. But it’s impossible to find an appropriate question. I realised how ridiculous it is to talk to ask her questions about the future or even the past. I’m talking from a distance, perched on a chair, observing her play, smoking cigarettes. To communicate with her I must get down on the floor and paint.

She’s laughing and being amazed talking to herself, “O! So Sarah must of went off and it was you Jane who was in control this whole time! Wow!” “Ah yeah, he wouldn’t have been able to tell because you still look the same” , “yeah, yeah”

“O Yeah, so I have multiple personalities.”
“I am many”

She’s beautifully cracked mad maelstrom of souls roaring within. Lord of her own populated universe. It’s why she can’t give up the meth … the meth psychosis keeps the other souls alive.

She asks nothing and expects nothing in return.

Ajax crashes out in the corner and I stay up with her all night attempting to capture her portrait in charcoal, captivated by the study of her face. We talk as I paint her I become aware that she is changed again, and I become completely convinced she is infact a drag queen and I’ve been blind this whole time.

I crash out in a camping chair and she sits beside me and pulls out a book from her handbag. It’s Goosebumps and we read chapters to each other until the sun rises.

When she finally does go to sleep she is dead to the world for almost forty-eight hours. Sarah coming off meth is a Logan Bogan dressed like a man with a mohawk that is usually hidden under her wigs, and she is stressed out and ill at ease. She is reduced to rocking on a chair smoking dumpers [cigarette ends] from a small brass pipe. As she loses control of the ensemble of personalities that she commands.

I want to help her. I want to take her into my arms and give her any comfort I can. 

She can’t do anything at the moment. She’s losing it without stimulation. Talking with herself. And now I can feel the full force of her agitation and I’m definitely annoyed and start to regret and resent her. So now it’s me who needs to meditate. And this time it’s me who changes character. Now I’m a Zen monk and I’m wearing just a bed sheet wrapped around me to look like a robe and I just sit here in half lotus with my hands on my knees, eyes opened, downcast, closed, it doesn’t matter. 

She’s about to blow her top off though yelling at the kids in her head and seems to be on the edge of tearing the place down, desperate for the stimulation of chaos and I tell her to let it all out, yell and scream all she wants, tear the place down if she needs to. But I just sit there observing, witnessing, listening. The more chaos the better; what do I care? I just weather the storm. I watch at the patterns of spilled paint on the floor, I observe my breath. I rest in peace. She eventually settles down and sits on a chair and is silent for a few minutes them murmuring again, then silent. 

She is saved by her own laughter

Returning from her walk, we are both painting and she is telling me about this guy she met at the park, Ryan, a Buddhist. And they did Tai Chi together and she feels so much better and silenced now. And she is all smiles and paints a portrait of him doing Tai Chi.

Last time I saw Sarah she was sitting on a brick ledge amongst the other drug addicts and rough sleepers, eating a free breakfast put on by the local Christian college kids. 

She has a messy blond wig on now, and it’s on backwards as she fixes her own silly plats, chatting and laughing away amongst herselves. A beacon of light amongst the hung heads and hopelessness. Her presence turns all these down and outers into gentleman.

Now Sarah has gone, and with the dawn of the day I go out walking Brunswick St alone. There will be a thousand people crossing paths along this street today, But at this hour it all belongs to one man. Cool wind blowing, heralding storms. There sits Ryan apon concrete pillar, shirtless, cargo pants, hiking boots, ropy muscles, straight iron bar spine, lion’s mane bending to the wind, thousand mile stare. Zen smoking dumped cigarette butt elbow up and pinky out, deep controlled breath, as though ceremoniously savouring a fine oolong.
