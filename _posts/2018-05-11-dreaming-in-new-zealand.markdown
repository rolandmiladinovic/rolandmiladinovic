2009, Winter. 

He stumbled out of ship across a midnight tarmac and inhaled his first breaths of jet fuel and cold New Zealand air. Dragging baggage, limping along the cattle line through the crushing gates, past security guards, luggage conveyor belts and finally arriving at the taxi rank, from where he was gathered up by a large tattooed maori of a man taxi driver.

“Hey bro, where are we going tonight?”

“hey man,  ——— backpackers if you can.”

“Sweet as. Welcome to New Zealand, bro. Whereabouts in Australia are you from?”

Heavy rain splashed against the windshield. Light beams cut across the darkness. The rain regularly cleared away to the beat of windscreen wiper blades.

“We don’t get many Aussies coming this way, bro—it’s usually us Kiwis heading over there.”

He got out of the taxi at a three story ivy covered and cracked old building with rickety steel fire escape ladders hanging from roof. A smiling young German girl at reception welcomed him in, checked his passport, then sent him on his way up stairs to a large room of bunk beds. He fell onto one of the bottom bunks and lay out supine with feet up on the rails of a bed too small—exhausted, delirious, happy---staring at the bunk above waiting for sleep and forgetfulness to arrive, fascinated by the sparks of optic nerve excitation dancing upon his vision. Overexposure to the internet, corroded myelin sheath nerves, and neurotoxic chemo brain damage induced high speed waking dreams of flickering internet memory: the clatter of electronic poker chips rang in his ears, digital decks of cards riffle shuffled fell to his rapid calculations.

He was an online poker player, and after one year of desperate study in solitude he had some money in the bank and would never work a regular job again---so he often said. Free to work his own hours anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

The twenty-four hour internet cafe he frequented was hidden away atop a small Sushi restaurant among rows of shops in central Christchurch. There was no lighting inside except for the flicker of the old CRT monitors and LED’s blinking out hard drive status. No heating either. The windows were covered over with video game advertising and anime heros. Network cables lay strewn about the floor in tangled knots which he’d carefully tread over every night before setting up his laptop in the corner---wearing headphones, drinking coffee, pulling up his hood in the biting cold. The three other regulars were all Asian men of approximately of the same age as him. One closely studied anime porno with a serious face, another played Starcraft ‘till dawn, and the other would just stare open mouthed at play-money roulette—clicking away at the hypnotic wheel.

He passed time sitting up on that rickety fire escape smoking cigarettes, reading books, and watching people moving about below. One day a woman arrived and sat down by his side asking if he’d like company. He thought perhaps he’d have to wait an eternity before a woman would finally visit him, looking as he did so bone thin and pale and being so antisocial, but it only took two months for gravity’s pull to achieve its work. She seemed of indeterminate age, pretty enough and blond, childlike but the lines of an old woman cutting across her face.

He spoke freely with her and they laughed and she was all smiles and reaching out for touch. She took his hand, she said, “you’re shaking dear!” He would tremble at the slightest stimulus, raw nerves short circuiting from lightning storms and woman. He asked about a ring she was wearing and off she went reciting her spiel on the significance of each item or jewelry: at least five bangles on each thin wrist, earrings, and a necklaces, all pertaining to various positions of the zodiac, the elements, animal signs, special stones, lucky charms, protection amulets. She’s aquarius and he’s gemini. All very important information.

He thinks she’s stupid with all her superstitions but as she she continues to speak in her mad way going off in tangents into surreal dreamscapes he has to admit that she obviously has a larger vocabulary than him, a better storyteller, funny even. Gradually he became drawn into her world of make-believe magic and played along because it was better.

They were drinking from a bottle of vodka she kept in her handbag and she playfully pulled up her shirt flashing her bra laughing. Sat on his lap and bouncing up and down with joy. He held her bum and slid his hand under her knickers. So off they trot down the dark streets in search of a bed. When money began falling from out her handbag in fifty dollar bills---maybe a thousand dollars blowing around the street. He rushed around gathering up the money and stuffing it back into her purse not daring to ask about it but laughing out loud at the scene.

They came upon an old colonial style house with a vacancy sign in the window. An elegant silver haired older woman was out front watering rhododendrons. “Excuse me, we are two lovers looking for a room,” Kasey says. The matron’s answer is whispered, soothing, husky. She looked at them lovingly as though two stray cats had come to her and ushered them inside with a light touch on the arm.

He laid his head on the flesh of her thigh, drunk on the post-fuck fog of content. She wanted to show him something and opened a map of New Zealand over which she held a silver chain and pendant steady, until it began to gently circle and swing. She bounced up and down on the bed with a little squeak and dropped the pendant and he laughed at her theatrics. It landed right at the top of the north Island. Close to Nelson, hippy surf town. That’s where she was going, would he join her? O please, please, please.

Early next morning they threw their bags into her little 85 model Mazda sky-blue wagon. She asked that he drive and he was glad. The wheel alignment was out, shaking the front-end. As they left the city and the roads opened up and a dream catcher swang from the rear view mirror counterbalancing against the corners. Through great tunnels of trees bowing down, then bursting out into landscapes of rolling hills flanked by rushing crystal rivers, and up in the distance large snow caped stone mountains hold fast towering upward and piercing into cotton wool clouds; passing farmlands of rolling fields with deer and sheep, then back into the tree tunnels. Flicking the shifter through the five speed box and giving it a bit of throttle cutting through the corners with windows down drinking in the cold air.

His eyes became heavy as lack of sleep caught up with him, and asked that she take the wheel and he tells her about my tormented sleep. 

She tells him that she’s a dreamer. And she tells me to try to stay lucid in my dreams. She says something like: Look at your hands. Are you dreaming? You will know just by looking at your hands. Look at your hands and ask yourself if you are dreaming, count your fingers, study your palms, memorise your lines. You’ll be dreaming one night and notice your hands and then you will know. You will know that you can control your dreams. Focus on sensations, sight, sound, touch, smell. When you learn to be aware when awake you will become aware in your dreams. to treat reality as a dream and dreaming as reality, you will walk between two worlds you’ll double the length of your life. Interpret your dream signs, even interpret the dream signs of your waking life. You hands are the controllers of dreams. Reach out with your hands. Awaken to the immediacy of the present! Wake up wake up wake up, you lazy bones! She yells at him and bursts out laughing. Every night as you lay in bed before going to sleep remember your day, run through the events of the day retracing your steps, and every morning when you awake do the same with your dream. Share your dreams with the woman who you are sleeping with or write them down. 

Then she changes into her older woman voice and says,
“Dreams have a terrible will-to-power, and we are all their victims” “Beware the other’s dream, if you are caught in the dreams of the other you are done for”. And again bursts out in a cackle of a laugh.

Like every other dream he’s running again at breakneck speed. Leaping over fallen trees, away from the terrible thing that wants kill. His hands come forward and he stars at them and he remembers to reality check! reality check! Burst out laughing for the thrill of it and of the knowing. Laughing maniacally as he leaps and bounds and never losing his pursuer but loving the beautiful forest and the speed at which he runs, the height at which he jumps. Getting away with it! Faster than death, faster than death. Find your hands, hands of ape, starter of fires, maker of tools, red handprints on ancient cave walls, typing at computers, sign of the benediction, hand of God, shadow puppet master, controller of dreams.

At Nelson a young busker played a slow and haunting violin rendition of Summertime that cut through the cold wintertime streets. Dead leaves blew across his path. Kasey had disappeared and he was left alone and desolate. 

He never played online poker again.
