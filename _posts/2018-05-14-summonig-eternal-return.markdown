running fast laughing\\
through gardens of forest\\
and ahead in the distance\\
a fleeting white frill\\
a dress disappearing
behind brushes\\
again!\\
my eyes don't deceive me\\
beckons for chasing\\
like lightening she flashes her eyes from behind branches\\
with winking glances\\
unfathomable eyes\\
my heart stood still in delight\\
my deep beating\\
she beheld me\\
a light tap of her foot on the floor of the forest\\
ankle bells calling\\
chasing, again chasing\\
I leap o’er rocks
wishing for dancing\\ 
I love her\\
but as I get near my love turns to fear\\
with leaps I dare nearer\\
but fall down in bushes\\
her hair down beside me\\
In my ear there are whispers\\
but where have you gone?\\
come back\\
When I feel on my collarbone\\
blood\\
a spider’s bite that itches

I pulled myself up out of the bushes still holding the little bite on my collar and walked out into the open park of freshly cut grass where I found two friends sitting at a park bench. They were animated with talk and laughter, but the mood was grim and apocalyptic in the clearing where the moon shone down. I called out a greeting and was welcomed like a brother.

The One, walked about, pacing, told us of premonitions of the end of the world. We discuss mankind's destiny as if we three megalomaniacs alone had the power to save the world or destroy it. But the other doesn’t believe in the end of the world. Humankind will always find away; a miracle at the last moment. The seed of life will always rise from the ashers.

The One picked up a tree branch for a stalf and drew out a circle on the grass floor between the three friends. Looked up with rueful suspicion as if offering up a challenge and said in cryptic lines: “Don’t stab me in the heart,” “the serpent from the garden of eden believes in all its innocence, hahaha” then began a to soliloquise in a commanding voice:

Information is being collected

“Here is the eternal ring of return (motioning with his hand around the imaginary circle), all things must return eternally. This life that you now know you will live innumerable times, over and over. We three are eternal travelers, to be marked and condemned for perpetual reincarnate into our own selves, over and over. All who enter this circle will be bound and married with this eternal ring and seal. And return to this exact same place on this exact same night under this very same moon, talking of eternity.”

Well I can’t think of anything worse.

If you can pass this judgment and test you will gain inconceivable power and command of life. but if you fail to bear it, it will crush you. You will have to be creators in this life to redeem yourselves and all of your past, to be able to say: I will it! What will you have to invent in order to redeem yourselves? Step in if you dare!

I took this child’s game of play acting so lightly at the time, as nothing but a comedy of absurdity. But this spontaneous symbolic acting and theatrics poured into my open acid mind speaking into me so bell-ringingly clear so that the memory is engraved there like a searing tattoo.

In my eye, the circle in the earth began to glow, and within I saw a fractal green grass scaled luminous ouroboros—that ancient serpent devouring its own tail and renewing life for eternity.

The One looked at his hands.

I feel a strange energy\\
my mind is alight\\
a thunderstorm of thoughts assails me\\
I dare to face the world and act\\
To share in all its joy and pain\\
Into the maelstrom\\
Death no longer shakes me\\

Clouds gather all around .The moon conceals its light. My eyes lose focus. Red light sparks and flashes about my head. A cold shadow moves across my heart. A electricity valts down from above—it grips me.

I feel your presence around me great spirit, you have found me!\\
Reveal yourself!\\
It tears my heart, I bleed!\\
I reach out to you\\
I have no fear!\\
If it should cost my life. Appear!

The One fell to the ground. “What is this vision!” ... “Every pain and suffering and torment repeated again and again for all time—tortured children forever crying out. Noooo!” Pulling at the grass in despair ... “But knowing, and knowing that you know.” ... “A laugh can redeem it all!” He says with unconvincing hope as he attempts to call up a divine laughter—but in vain. He holds the sign of a handgun to the side of his head and faces us on his knees. And I guess it’s our role to talk him down and give him reasons to live, but who can give another man a reasons not to return to eternal bliss, of nothing, of childhood, of death, of rebirth, …
