Running\\
Through gardens of forest\\
When ahead in the distance\\
A fleeting white figure\\
A dress disappearing\\
Behind brushes\\
Again!\\
Beckons for chasing\\
Like lightening she flashed her eyes from behind branches\\
Wicked glances\\
My heart stood still\\
A light tap of her foot on the floor of the forest\\
Ankle bells calling\\
Chasing, again chasing\\
I leapt o’er rocks\\
Wishing for dancing\\
I love her\\
But as I drew near my love turned to fear\\
With leaps I dared catch her\\
But fell down in bushes\\
Her hair down beside me\\
In my ear there were whispers\\
But where had she gone?\\
“Come back!”\\
I felt on my collarbone\\
Blood\\
A spider’s bite itching

I pulled myself up from the bushes still holding the little bite on my collar and walked out into an open clearing of freshly cut grass where I found two friends sitting at a park bench. They were animated with talk and laughter, but the mood was heavy and apocalyptic as the moon shone down upon the scene. I called out a greeting and was welcomed like a brother.

He walked about with nervous energy, stout, regal, pacing, telling us his premonitions of the end and of the most likely way that humanity will be annalited. We discuss mankind's destiny as if we three megalomaniacs alone had the power to save or destroy it the world. But the other doesn’t believe in the end of the world. Humankind will always find away, a miracle at the last moment. A seed of life will always rise from the ashers.

Our talking became abstract. Trading random words and weighing their effects. “Doom” hits me square in the stomach. I read my own meanings into random sentences of words and pary back with a few of my favourite words. Complete nonsense, but somehow we believed we were communicating profoundly, even telepathically.

He appeared hurt and picked up a tree branch for a stalf and drew out a circle on the grass floor between the three friends. Looked up with mocking suspicion in his eye as if offering a challenge and said in cryptic lines: “Don’t stab me in the heart when we are sparing, you know the serpent of Eden believes in all its innocence.”

He: “Behold, the ring of eternal return (motioning with his hand around the imaginary circle), all things must return eternally. This life as you know it will be lived innumerable times over. We three are eternal travelers, marked and condemned for perpetual reoccurrence. All who enter this circle will be bound and married with this eternal ring and seal. To return to this place, on this very same night, under this moon, talking of eternity.”

“If you can pass this judgment and test you will gain inconceivable power and command. but if you fail to bear it---it will crush you. You will have to be creators in this life to redeem yourselves and all of your past, to be able to say: I will it! What will you have to invent in order to redeem yourselves? Step in if you dare!”

Information is being collected by machines, collecting the fragments needed for simulation of the next inexorable return.

I took this child’s game of play acting so lightly at the time, as nothing but a comedy of absurdity. But this spontaneous symbolic acting and theatrics poured directly into my open acid mind, speaking into me so bell-ringingly clear so that the memory is engraved like a searing tattoo.

In my eye, the circle in the earth began to glow, and within I saw a fractal green grass scaled luminous ouroboros—that ancient serpent eternally devouring its own tail.

He looked at his hands:

I feel a strange energy\\
my mind is alight\\
a maelstrom of thought assails me\\
I dare to face the world and act\\
To share in all its joy and pain\\
To play in chaos\\
Death no longer shakes me\\

Clouds gather around; The moon conceals its light; My eyes lose focus; Red light sparks and flashes about my head; A cold shadow moves across my heart; A force valts down from above—it grips me.

He:

I feel your presence around me great spirit\\
you have found me!\\
Reveal yourself!\\
It tears my heart, I bleed!\\
I reach out to you\\
I have no fear!\\
If it should cost my life. Appear!

He fell to the ground. “What is this vision!” ... “Every pain and suffering and torment repeated again and again for all time—tortured children forever crying out. Noooo!” Pulling at the grass in despair ... “But knowing, and knowing that you know.” ... “A laugh can redeem it all!” He says with unconvincing hope as he attempts to call up a divine laughter—but in vain. He holds the sign of a handgun to the side of his head and faces us on his knees. And I guess it’s our role to talk him down and give him reasons to live, but who can give another man a reasons not to return to eternal bliss.
