title:  "DMT Death Trip"

I first encountered dimethyltryptamine down in that labyrinthine virtual underworld that is the dark web, searching for something to buy with the Bitcoin I'd been gifted by some random anon from the #anonOps Internet Relay Chat room, back in 2009, back when whole Bitcoins were mere play money and the children of the internet were wearing Guy Fawkes masks as they played at computers.

After initially recoiling in horror from my introduction to the dark web and just ripping the ethernet cable from out of the socket, I found myself browsing the advertisements for various illicit drugs: speed, steroids, weed, nootropics, psychedelics. But it was an out-of-this-world transiate domain for DMT that so fascinated and obsessed me. I was promised a short, safe, and non addictive fifteen minutes of chemically induced religious ecstasy, a glimpse into the occult mechanics of consciousness, temporary knowledge of enlightenment. All for such a very low price! The product image on the site was of a tiny pile of clear DMT crystals, apparently extracted from the ayahuasca vine from the Amazon jungle, somewhere where shamanism was still a thing. The webpage was all embellished and decorated with technicolor fractal geometric Aztec iconography. There were rudimentary notes on mysticism, awakening, higher consciousness, and safety procedures associated with ego death. Information apparently passed down from the ancient shamans of old and sent out through the optic-neural-nerves-fibre of the internet to every wanna-be cyber-psychonaut who so desired it. All of this was completely and diametrically opposed to my then profane, disenchanted, so rational worldview where art and religion were but noise to the child who worshipped the logic of the machine. Mathematics, logic, programming and science was the thing. Reading further I was informed that five percent of the the proceeds would go directly to protecting the Amazon jungle and its native peoples. Such an ethical deal! Repayment of my bad karma for buying drugs online was already included in the price.

A few days later a small package arrived at my doorstep, discreetly stamped with a familiar geometric sigil just under my address and alias. The package contained a set of marker pens and Inside the chamber of one was a ziplock bag of the crystals wrapped in a note. With fear I hid them inside the case of my computer, there they stayed for six months.

Until finally one day I was sitting there alone in the centre of my then empty hospital-fluorescent-white cubic studio apartment, breathing deeply and deliberately, calling up all of my courage and calm. I’d packed a freshly cleaned glass water pipe with a thin layer of dried and ground blue lotus, gently placed the crystals on top and covered them with more of the blue lotus herb. Then I held the loaded pipe to my mouth and began some deep breathing exercises. Sitting with crossed legs, my heart beating against my rib cage as I advanced towards ego suicide.

I read silently from the included note entitled Self-annihilating Talk, “I am not my thoughts, I am that which observes, the witness, the all-seeing I, the axis centre of nothing around which the world turns; I am not my fear, I am not the thoughts that swim across the lake of consciousness. Let it all pass on by until nothing remains.”
Finally telling myself that all great knowledge is acquired only at great risk, and pledging my allegiance to the universe where I acquire the DMT knowledge, I draw in deeply and calmly to the cracking sparks of the water pipe. The exhaust vapour poured out in an azure of tribal tattoo ink pattern that permeated all space. I placed the water pipe down between my legs and let myself fall back onto the bed. Further I fell down, down through the bed, into the bedrock of the back of my mind. The world gave way; the dream began.

To be continued.
