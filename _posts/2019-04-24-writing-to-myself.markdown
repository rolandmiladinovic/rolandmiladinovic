I’m here again at a blank page with nothing to say and no dreams to record in my journal. Well fine! Then be silent! Be grateful for an empty mind, it’s better that way. Just enjoy the scratching on paper, the spilling of ink across pages, and typing at computers. I’ll write in fine cursive and by chance the curve of a rogue letter will begin a fine drawing. Now I must paint because all of the words in this world are insufficient, even the ones I haven’t yet learnt. Because there are not enough words to tell a true story and so all of my writing is so false and fictitious. And all of my writing is so repetitive. Because it is forever remembering to remember this moment. So it never really matters where I start because I always come back here, to myself and this moment. To these absurd man hands typing and writing and coding at computers and playing at pianos. But it never really matters where I start because I always seem to come back to myself and the moment. What matters is that I do start! That I tell myself everyday. Start, start, start! It’s a new beginning. That is my practice. That is what each day I practice. A new beginning, starting at the same place, an empty page. Here where I empty myself so that I can become full again. And I repeat myself over and over, so that I remember where I am and what I am.

I’m here at mcDonald's, as good a place as a place as any to try and remember all of my morning meditations and mantras, along with black coffee, free wifi and power. As good a place as any to remember, remember to breath from your belly like a baby, and to feel the cold of the morning sink into your bones.

Now, now, now. The time has come and you are the chosen one! The emergency of the moment calls out to you on your inexorable march towards death. Look! Look out upon the day and the night and let your laughter ring out across all time. Time, time, time, the time of your death is come. Eternity is found in the moment. The horrors of death is the death with live and not the death of the body. Live! Live forever more simply and give away all possessions. Give freely and the well of creativity will become inexhaustible. So speak I with a collage of phrase that come from my masters, with words from the bible of King James and with letters from ancient Rome. I’m a fraud, I’m a thief.

Here again, typing fast, as the wind blows. Frantically doing nothing, spinning wheels, so that I may be allowed to do nothing. Out! Spit out all of my feelings and opinions that come from other people. It’s the same old story with I continually tell myself what I am every day. I reflect. I reflect myself onto a page so that I may see myself and this story that I tell myself everyday. Through this process of self annihilation I empty my mind of the word virus, of the spelling of spells and the words of other people, my masters, who control me.

And then my pen slipped and a curve of a line became a neat circle, which became the circle of eternal return. So that I craved for immortality of the soul. But heaven is on earth, and immortality of the soul is obtained with awareness of eternity within each moment, so my teachers tell me. And as I die I will see forever into all time and will be immortal. So I come back to this moment to discover what I’m doing and the meaning of why I’m doing it, the why and what for of my writing.
