I’m here again at a blank page with nothing to say and no dreams to record in my new journal. Well fine! Be silent! Be grateful for an empty mind and just enjoy the scratching on paper and the spilling of ink across blank pages. I’ll write in fine cursive and par chance the curve of a letter will begin a new drawing and new understandings. Now, I must paint because all of the words in this world are so insufficient, even the ones I haven’t yet learnt. There are not enough words in this world to tell a true story and so all of my writing rings false and fictitious. And why is it that all of my writing repeats and is so repetitious? Perhaps it's because I’m trying forever to remember to remember to live in this moment. So it never would matter where I begin as I would always come back to where I am, to myself and this moment. What matters is that I start! This I tell myself myself everyday. Start, start, start! It’s a new beginning. That is my practice. That is what I practice every day. A new beginning, starting at the same place, an empty page. Here, where I empty myself so that I may become full again. And thus I repeat myself over and over, so that I may remember what it is that I am doing, why I am here, and who on Earth I am. Ahh yes, here I am at MacDonald's, it’s as good a place as any to start, so I try to remember all of my morning meditations and mantras, along with my black coffee, free wifi and power. As good a place as any to remember. Remember to breath from your belly like a baby, walk around barefooted and swing on tree branches. Now, now, now. The time has come and you are the chosen one! The emergency of the moment calls out to you on your inexorable march towards death. Look! Look out upon the day and the night and let your laughter ring out across all time and forever after. Time, time, time. The time of your death is come. Eternity has found you in the moment and ready. The horrors of death is the death within life (the walking dead, in zombies) and not of the death of the body. Live! Live forever more simply and give away everything. Give freely and the well of creativity will become inexhaustible. So speak I with my collage of phrases that come to me from my masters. With words from the bible and letters from ancient Rome. I’m a fraud, I’m a thief, I’m a liar. Here again, typing fast, as the wind blows. Frantically fighting, spinning wheels, so that I may be allowed to do nothing. Out! Kick out of the womb. Spit out all of my feelings and opinions that come from other people. It’s the same old story with which I continually tell to myself about what I am, every day. I reflect. I reflect myself onto a page so that I may see myself and the story that I tell myself everyday. Through this process of self annihilation I empty my mind of the word viruses, of the spelling of spells and of the words of my own and of so many other people, my masters, who thus control me. And then my pen slipped and a curve of a line became a neat circle, and it was the circle of eternal return. So that I craved for immortality of my soul. But heaven is on earth, and immortality of the soul is obtained with awareness of eternity within each moment, so my teachers told me. And as I die I will see forever into all time and will be immortal. So I come back to this moment to discover what I’m doing and the meaning of why I’m doing it, the why and what for of my writing.
