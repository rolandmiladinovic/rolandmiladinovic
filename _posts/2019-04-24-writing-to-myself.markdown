I’m here again at a blank page with nothing to say and no dreams to record in my new journal. Well fine! Then be silent! Be grateful for an empty mind, it’s better that way. Just enjoy the scratching on paper and the spilling of ink across pages. I’ll write in fine cursive and by chance the curve of a rogue letter will begin a fine drawing. Now I must paint because all of the words in this world are insufficient, even the ones I haven’t yet learnt. There are not enough words to tell a true story and so all writing is false and fictitious. Why is it that all of my writing is so repetitive? Because it is a forever remembering to remember this moment. So it never really matters where I begin because I always come back to where I am, to myself and this moment. What matters is that I start! That I tell myself everyday. Start, start, start! It’s a new beginning. That is my practice. That is what I practice every day. A new beginning, starting at the same place, an empty page. Here, where I empty myself so that I can become full again. And I repeat myself over and over, so that I may remember where I am and what I am here doing.

I’m here at mcDonald's, it’s as good a place as any to try and remember all of my morning meditations and mantras, along with black coffee, free wifi and power. As good a place as any to remember. Remember to breath from your belly like a baby. Now, now, now. The time has come and you are the chosen one! The emergency of the moment calls out to you on your inexorable march towards death. Look! Look out upon the day and the night and let your laughter ring out across all time. Time, time, time. The time of your death is come. Eternity is found in the moment. The horrors of death is the death within life and not the death of the body. Live! Live forever more simply and give away everything. Give freely and the well of creativity will become inexhaustible. So speak I with a collage of phrase that come to me from masters. With words from the bible and letters from ancient Rome. I’m a fraud, I’m a thief.

Here again, typing fast, as the wind blows. Frantically doing nothing, spinning wheels, so that I may be allowed to do nothing. Out! Spit out all of my feelings and opinions that come from other people. It’s the same old story with which I continually tell to myself about what I am, every day. I reflect. I reflect myself onto a page so that I may see myself and the story that I tell myself everyday. Through this process of self annihilation I empty my mind of the word viruses, of the spelling of spells and of the words of myself and so many other people, my masters, who control me.

And then my pen slipped and a curve of a line became a neat circle, and it was the circle of eternal return. So that I craved for immortality of my soul. But heaven is on earth, and immortality of the soul is obtained with awareness of eternity within each moment, so my teachers told me. And as I die I will see forever into all time and will be immortal. So I come back to this moment to discover what I’m doing and the meaning of why I’m doing it, the why and what for of my writing.
