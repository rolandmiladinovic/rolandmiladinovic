I’m here again at a blank page with nothing to say and no recent dreams to record within my new journal. Well fine! Then be silent! Be grateful for an empty mind and just enjoy the scratching on paper and the spilling of ink running across blank pages. I’ll write in fine cursive and par chance the curve of a letter will begin a new drawing and new understandings. So now I must paint because all of the words in this world are so insufficient, even the ones I haven’t to learnt yet. There are not enough words in this world to tell a true story and so all of my writings ring false and fictitious. And why is it that all of my writing repeats and is so repetitious? Perhaps it's because I’m trying forever to remember to remember to live in this moment. So it never would matter where I begin as I would always come back to where I am, to myself and this moment. What matters is that I start! This I tell myself myself everyday. Begin! It’s a new beginning. That is my practice. That is what I practice every day. A new beginning, starting at the same place, an empty page. Here, where I empty myself so that I may become full again. And thus I repeat to myself over and over, so that I may remember what it is that I am doing, why I am here, and who on Earth I am. Ahh yes, here I am at MacDonald's, it’s as good a place as any to start, so I try to remember all of my morning meditations and mantras, along with my black coffee, free wifi and power. As good a place as any to remember. Remember to breath from your belly like a baby, walk around barefooted and swing from tree branches. Now, now, now. The time has come and you are the chosen one! The emergency of the moment calls out to you on your inexorable march towards death and true madness. Look! Look out upon the day and the night and let your laughter ring out across all of time and forever after. Time, time, time. The time of your death is come and awaiting. Eternity has found you in this moment and ready. The horrors of death are the deaths within life (the walking deaths and zombies) and not of the death of the body. Live! Live forever more simply and give away everything. Give freely and the well of creativity will become inexhaustible. So speak I with my collages and phrases that come down to me from my masters and the ages. With words from the bible and letters from ancient Rome. I’m a fraud, I’m a thief, I’m a liar. Here again, typing fast, as the winds blowing. Frantically fighting, spinning wheels, so that I may be allowed to do nothing. Out! Kick out of the womb. Spit out all of my feelings and opinions that come from other people. It’s the same old story with which I continually tell to myself about what I am, every day. I reflect. I reflect myself onto this page so that I may see myself and the storys that I tell myself.Through this process of self annihilation and self study I empty my mind of my word viruses, of the spelling of spells and of the words of my own and of so many other people, my masters, who thus control me. And then my pen slipped and a curve of a line became a neat circle, and it was the circle of eternal return. So that I craved for immortality. But heaven is on earth, and immortality of the soul is obtained with awareness of eternity within each moment, so my teachers told me. And as I died I sawwill see forever into all time and will be immortal. So I come back to this moment to discover what it is that I’m doing, my destiny and the meaning of why I’m doing it, my writing.
